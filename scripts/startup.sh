# # This script supports the following environment vars:
# #  - WEB_MEMORY: the amount of memory each
# #    process is expected to consume, in MB.
# if [[ -n "$WEB_MEMORY" ]]; then
#   # The heap contains two main areas:
#   #
#   # New Space: all newly allocated objects are created here first.
#   # The new space is often small (typically 1-8 MB), and it is
#   # fast to collect garbage here.
#   #
#   # Old Space: any objects which are not garbage collected from
#   # New Space eventually end up here. The vast majority of your
#   # heap will be consumed by Old Space. Garbage collection is slower
#   # here, as the size of Old Space is much larger than New Space,
#   # and a different mechanism is employed to actually perform the collection.
#   #
#   # For this reason, garbage collection is only performed when there is not
#   # much room left in Old Space. So, it makes sense to concentrate on the
#   # heapâ€™s Old Space when targeting memory usage.


#   # The WEB_MEMORY environment variable is set. Set the `mem_old_space_size`
#   # flag to 4/5 of the available memory. 4/5 has been determined via trial
#   # and error to be the optimum value, to try and ensure that v8 uses the
#   # available memory.
